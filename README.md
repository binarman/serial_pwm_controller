## MCU based PWM fan controller for linux

Project has two parts: MCU firmware and software service for linux.

MCU firmare is compatible with esp32 MCUs and atmega328.
Thanks for atmega PWM initialization to [hlovdal](https://stackoverflow.com/users/23118/hlovdal) for [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64864315/15324164), which saved me a lot of time.
